## ehrenschwan

I'm a 23 yr old software developer from Germany.

I've been mostly focused on web-development but I'm interested in a lot of forms of developing. I've used Linux for a few years and have lately gotten into infrastructure and devops.

### Open source projects and tools I enjoy

- [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux)
- [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)
- [Docker](https://github.com/docker)
- [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)
- [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible)

Note: I host my own git server, so the stats are not really representative of the work I'm doing.
