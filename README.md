## ehrenschwan

I'm a 21 yr old software developer from Germany. I'm currently in my second year of professional training, aiming to be finished in the beginning of 2024.

I've been mostly focused on web-development but I'm interested in a lot of forms of developing. I've used Linux for a few years and have lately gotten into infrastructure and devops.

###### Information is power

> I believe information should be shared if possible. Equal access to information is an important step towards equality. Withdrawal of information for security  mostly creates a false sense of security and is rarely needed. Open source is holding together the world as we know it and it is only going to be more important in the future.
